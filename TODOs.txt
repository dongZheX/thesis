TODOs:
------
Say that the numerical results are OK for beta < 5.
The electric field boundary layer scales approximately like exp(-beta/2).
The streamline solution is approximately symmetrical - error as the function of beta.
The physics:
* For small beta, the linear regime dominates.
* For moderate beta, the velocity results fit well to affine function of beta.
do - correlation of the numerical Psi to Stokes Psi.

* Validation of numerical results
* Ion-exchanger.
* Large beta results.
 * Numerical Results
 * Physical results
  - Affine fit
  - Boundary layer for Er (exp(beta/2))
  - Show a plot of C boundary layer (without normalization)
  - Fluid velocity
* Future work:
 - Analytic model
 - More parameters tuning
