A should be symmetric - since the continuous problem is self-adjoint
Conservation laws (Gauss Flux Law -> Stokes Theorem) should hold in discrete world too.
Operator null space can be interesting - DC / rigid rotations.
Uniform grid - OK for 3rd order poly.
Non-uniform grid - OK for 2nd order poly.


* Sparse matrix is not needed for regular grid - use variable matrix instead
* Add doc. for interior idea.
* Red Black G.S.
* Pre-define index matrices, for grid sampling
* Verify 2nd order convergence

Symmetry: The effect of Ui in eq. #j is the same as Uj in eq. #i.
If the grid is non-uniform, we should pre-multiply with D from left: [DAv = Df]
Each equation must be rescaled by (x_{i+1} - x_{i-1})(y_{j+1} - y_{j-1}).
Renaming:
 T -> iters
 v -> u
 A-D -> C/E
 J -> Dinv
 R -> S/M
 Dxx + Dyy -> stencil
Explain ind2sub() and stencil creation.
Compute residual with vector norm L2 and semilogy()
MPE/RRE
Eliminate boundary conditions from Laplacian.
Move non-homogenous boundary conditions to RHS
Keep the diagonal correct (for Jacobi iteration).

Note that if A has non-constant diagonal, Dinv*A is not symmetric.
We should use another finite difference scheme for Neumann.
Try extend to MG.
Add diffusion-convection equation for C(x,y).
