A should be symmetric - since the continuous problem is self-adjoint
Conservation laws (Gauss Flux Law -> Stokes Theorem) should hold in discrete world too.
Operator null space can be interesting - DC / rigid rotations.
Uniform grid - OK for 3rd order poly.
Non-uniform grid - OK for 2nd order poly.


* Sparse matrix is not needed for regular grid - use variable matrix instead
* Add doc. for interior idea.
* Red Black G.S.
* Pre-define index matrices, for grid sampling
* Verify 2nd order convergence

Symmetry: The effect of Ui in eq. #j is the same as Uj in eq. #i.
If the grid is non-uniform, we should pre-multiply with D from left: [DAv = Df]
Each equation must be rescaled by (x_{i+1} - x_{i-1})(y_{j+1} - y_{j-1}).
Renaming:
 T -> iters
 v -> u
 A-D -> C/E
 J -> Dinv
 R -> S/M
 Dxx + Dyy -> stencil
Explain ind2sub() and stencil creation.
Compute residual with vector norm L2 and semilogy()
MPE/RRE
Eliminate boundary conditions from Laplacian.
Move non-homogenous boundary conditions to RHS
Keep the diagonal correct (for Jacobi iteration).

Note that if A has non-constant diagonal, Dinv*A is not symmetric.
We should use another finite difference scheme for Neumann.
Try extend to MG.
Add diffusion-convection equation for C(x,y).

Use Neumann conditions on R = infinity
Less iterations for coupled solution
Test coupling effect on convergence speed

Switch to polar coordinates
Stokes equation: 
 Momentum : -\lapl V + \grad P = F
 Mass     : \div V = 0
 Incompressible uniform fluid.
Discretization 
P is in cell's center
V is on cell's boundaries
Boundary conditions are given on grid boundary.

Organize variables (P, Vx, Vy).

Neumann conditions allow mass conservation.

Vanka:
 Jacobi on several equations simultaneously.
 Use cell's P and V = 5 variables (on boundary there are less).
 Red-Black update may help out.

Think:
Upwind conservation rules?
C is dipole concentration.
P has no boundary conditions?

Lookup: 
* Block Relaxation, Block Jacobi, Additive Schwartz Method, Domain Decomposition
* Saddle Point Problem: [A B; B' 0] form
The matrix may not be PD - but should be symmetric if -div(U,V) = 0 is taken.
Note that all x=(U,V,P) components must converge.
Why there is "Wavy" convergence?
Write Ax=0, with <P>=0 re-normalization will converge to ~1e-300.
Test for <e,e> or |<e,r>|=|<e,Ae>|
Energy notion: min{1/2||Vx||^2-x^T f} => V^T Vx = f

Rewrite Vanka's method (and re-iterate!)
Verify 2nd poly. order for non-uniform grid.
Couple all 3 equations using boundary conditions, 1 iteration per update.
