A should be symmetric - since the continuous problem is self-adjoint
Conservation laws (Gauss Flux Law -> Stokes Theorem) should hold in discrete world too.
Operator null space can be interesting - DC / rigid rotations.
Uniform grid - OK for 3rd order poly.
Non-uniform grid - OK for 2nd order poly.


* Sparse matrix is not needed for regular grid - use variable matrix instead
* Add doc. for interior idea.
* Red Black G.S.
* Pre-define index matrices, for grid sampling
* Verify 2nd order convergence
