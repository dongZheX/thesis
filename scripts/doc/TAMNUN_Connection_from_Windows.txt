Dear TAMNUN Users,

Below please find instructions for connecting to the TAMNUN server and
running jobs on it. Preliminary information on working in Linux
environment can be found at the following link:

http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~tamnun/linenv/


1) Connection to server TX via GoGlobal
==========================================
In order to connect to Linux servers from your Windows PC please
use X-windows emulator s/w GoGlobal

http://www.technion.ac.il/usg/x-emu/GoGlobal/GG2.2.8_InstallationInstruction.pdf

NB: GoGlobal connection to TX is available from any computer (also from home and from abroad).

2) Connection to TAMNUN
=======================
After you obtain connection to tx.technion.ac.il, please doubleclick on
the Xterm icon from the GoGlobal connection panel. In the window that opens
please write

> ssh user@tamnun.technion.ac.il [Enter]

and then your TAMNUN password at the prompt. Thus connection to the server
TAMNUN is established. The default quota for the TAMNUN users is 10 Gb.
You can check the disk space usage by typing

> quota -v [Enter]

in the TAMNUN Xterm window.

3) Running programs on TAMNUN
=============================
By ssh to TAMNUN you login to the head node. Here you can create, edit
and compile you code, and then submit it to the Portable Batch SYstem (PBS)
for execution. For information about using PBS please consult the relevant
documents at the web site

http://tamnun.technion.ac.il/doc/Local-help/

(e.g. TAMNUN_PBS_USAGE.pdf). It is not recommended to run your code interactively,
but it is possible for debugging purposes.

4) Secure File transfer from Windows to Linux
=============================================
In order to transfer files to/from your
Windows PC please download and install WinSCP freeware. In the Login
window specify

 server: tamnun.technion.ac.il
 Port: 22
 user: username
 password: your TAMNUN password
 File Protocol: SCP

You can save the Login definitions for further usage. After login WinSCP
opens the window which represents your home directory on TAMNUN where you
can transfer files by drag-n-drop action.

NB: Winscp access to TAMNUN is available only in the Technion local network
